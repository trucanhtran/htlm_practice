              The collection contains faithful reproductions of gargoyles from
              some of the famous cathedrals of Europe, including Notre Dame,
              Rheims and Warwick Castle. All reproductions are done to
              exacting and loving detail.
            </p>
            <p>
              The collection also contains original works by noted artists
              such as Susan Bedford and Antonio Salvari. Our expert artisans

              Don't think you need a gargoyle? Think again. Gargoyles are

              This month's artist is Michael Cassini. Michael has been a
              professional sculptor for ten years. He has won numerous awards,
              including the prestigious Reichsman Cup and an Award of Merit at
              the 1997 Tuscany Arts Competition.

              Michael specializes in recreations of gargoyles from European
              cathedrals. You'll usually find Michael staring intently at the
              church walls in northern France. His work is represented by the
              Turin Gargoyle, a great entry to our Gargoyle Collection.
