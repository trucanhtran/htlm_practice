                        with
                        her ability to learn the details of our sophisticated and complex hardware and software,
                        especially
                        given her lack of telecommunications experience when she first started with us. Mary works well
                        in a
                        team but also has the ability to take my suggestions and finish a project in a highly competent
                        manner without further direction. As she closes out her work here, I find her to be an excellent
                        and
                        essential component in our operations. I have complete confidence that you will be very pleased
                        with
                        Mary’s work and recommend her very highly."

                            "Mary Taylor is one of the most extraordinary students I have ever encountered. A hard
                            worker,
                            she earned straight A’s in three courses taught by me. I was so impressed by her ability, I
                            asked her to help tutor several students in the courses I was teaching. The performance of
                            those
                            students improved dramatically, a result that I attribute solely to Mary. She has the knack
                            of
                            being able to explain complicated ideas in a straight-forward and clear manner. Not only is
                            Mary
                            the proverbial joy to work with, she has high standards of integrity, reliability, and
                            quality
                            of work. I really cannot overstate her talents."
